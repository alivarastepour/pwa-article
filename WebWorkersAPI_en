Web Workers API

Web Workers makes it possible to run a script operation in a background thread separate from the main execution thread of a web application. The advantage of this is that laborious processing can be performed in a separate thread, allowing the main (usually the UI) thread to run without being blocked/slowed down.

Note: Web Workers can also use the Web Worker API (i.e. workers can spawn workers, provided they are hosted within the same origin as the parent page).
